# Apply scale with modifiers

Used to unify visual size of modifiers. 

## Usage

In object mode select objects needed to be edited. Select the last object to make it active. 

Press ctrl + L. Select `Unify modifiers` option.

You can disallow the script to affect some modifiers by hiding them in viewport on the `active` object. 
In this case they will still affect the position of others modifiers.

For example, you have 2 objects with 2 bevels. 
If you want to copy the first bevel from the first object to the first bevel from the second object.

## How it works.

## Options

1. `Use names` - The script will match modifiers name instead of position.
Use it if you want the script working from the top of the stack to the bottom as well.
2. `Copy all attributes` - The script will copy all modifiers attributes, not only the size.
